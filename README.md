# Artificial Neural Networks Practice: Predicting COVID-19 in Greece

## Objective

This practice aims to apply the learned concepts about artificial neural networks to solve a dynamic prediction problem in a medical context. In particular, we will implement and evaluate neural network models in Python to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in Greece.

We hope that the student can demonstrate their analysis skills and obtain meaningful conclusions from the results obtained.

## Approach

The practice proposes the use and analysis of Artificial Neural Network models for a dynamic prediction problem in the epidemiological field.

The data to be used are the confirmed cases of COVID-19 obtained from the following link:

[COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv)

This repository contains time series of confirmed COVID-19 cases for different countries. In our case, we will focus on the time series corresponding to Greece.

The main objective is to predict future COVID-19 cases based on historical data. The provided data represent the accumulated number of cases, so we must first calculate the daily increments in the number of cases to have a variable that we can analyze and predict.

## Code

The code for this practice is available in this repository. We invite you to explore it and to make any questions or suggestions you may have.

## Results

The results of our practice will be presented in the form of graphs and analysis in the corresponding notebook. This will include the evaluation of the fit quality and predictive ability of our neural network model.

We hope you find this practice interesting and that it helps you better understand how neural networks can be applied to real prediction problems in the field of medicine.
